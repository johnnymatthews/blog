title: "Manufacturing developer relations"
description: "Developer relations, or devrel, is essentially a programmers version of a customer success team. It's all about building relationships between a tech company, and the developers who use that company's stuff. Setting up a devrel team or strategy can be tricky, and there's one huge pitfall I see companies fall into again and again."

## Devrel for beginners

There are five main responsibilites of a devrel team:

1. **Advertise**: Basically just hype and shill the company's products and services to external developers.
1. **Build a community**: Create an active community around the company's offerings. Generally speaking this involves: 
    - Organizing events like hackathons, conferences, and meetups.
    - Providing resources like project template, boilerplate code, and environment setup scripts.
    - Setting up communication channels for external developers to connect to each other.
1. **Provide support**: Give external developers the help they need through technical support, documentation, tutorials, and other resources to use the company's products effectively.
1. **Give feedback**: Listen to what developers have to say, get their insights and wish lists to help improve products down the line, and feed that to the internal engineering teams.
1. **Advocate**: Be the voice for external developers _inside_ the company, and make sure their needs and concerns are heard.

If you've ever worked in, or heard of, a customer success team than you might recognie some similaries here. Customer success teams make sure that the customers of a company are having an easy time working with said company, and have an avenue to allow their thoughts/fears/concerns to be addressed. In a similar way, developer relations teams try to enable external developers to make really cool stuff.

Let's say, for example, that there's a company called _Massive Corp_ that has a product called _massive.js_. The main use-case for Massive.js is to allow developers to handle requests from millions of users at once. In this case, a devrel team would focus on creating examples of how to use Massive.js, foster startups and small projects who have a need for something like Massive.js, and go to events promoting the use of Massive.js. It's important that the world has as many `.js` projects as possible, otherwise GitHub would grind to a halt.

## The Pitfall

Now that we've covered the basics of what a devrel team does, we can get into the juicy side of where devrel strategies fall apart. It all comes down to one question:

**_Do you let the community grow organically, or do you try to stimulate growth artificially?_**

    
## Let's talk about video games

_Organic or artifical growth_ is a weird question, and to understand the answer we need to turn to the world of competative video games.

### Dota and Blizzard

Back in the early 2000s, there was this wildly popular custom map for Warcraft 3 called _Defense of the Ancients_ (eventually just shortened to Dota). The basic premis was that you had two teams of players controlling powerful heroes trying to push through waves of enemies and destroy the other team's base. This type of game became known as a _massive online battle arena_ (MOBA). It was great and it inspired a bunch of spinoff games like League of Legends and Heroes of Newerth. Eventually Valve bought the rights to Dota and created _Dota 2_ in 2013.

This whole situation really upset Blizzard because they felt that _they_ owned Dota, and thus Dota 2. See; the Blizzard lawyers reckoned that because the game was created in a tool created by Blizzard, then it was _owned_ by Blizzard. This was a silly notion which caused Blizzard and Valve to go to court and file a suit in which Blizzard lost of a lot of money and even more respect from the gaming community.

So Blizzard decided to create a new game.

Like all MOBAs, [Heroes of the Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_the_Storm) (HotS) is a direct copy of Dota. Two teams, two bases, a bunch of mobs, some neutral creeps, and lots of heroes for the players to choose from. Simple.

### The competitive scene

It's fair to say that most online games have a competiteve scene: a community of players who battle out to be _the best_. Dota's competative scene is pretty big. According to [escharts.com](https://escharts.com/games/dota2), Dota 2 ranks #6 for all-time peek viewership, and #1 in total prize pool with a massive $313 million in available. This huge competivie scene span up over many, _many_ years, with the first known Dota [competition happening in March 2006](https://dota2.fandom.com/wiki/History_of_Competitive_DotA_(The_First_Light_of_Dawn:_The_6.2x_Era)).

Blizzard, in an attempt to claim some marketshare from Dota, span up it's own competition alongside the launch of Heroes of the Storm.

- Blizzard aggressivly pushed for a comp scene.
    - There were some problems though:
        - Lack of interest in the game initially.
        - Lack of focus from teams and sponsors.
        - Problems with the tournament tech.
        - Tiny viewership.

<!-- Back to devrel -->

    - Companies that force devrel follow the same path as Blizzard:
        - No real interest in the product.
        - Large sponsors/vendors/projects want to take on the product
            It's untested. They want to see organic growth.
        - Running small-scale hackathons only gets you so far.
        - It can get horrendously expensive.

<!-- Run devrel properly -->

    - Docs first. 
    - Examples second. 
    - Community growth third.
        - Kinda. It's ok to have a community who's excited for the project.
        - Just don't try to manually grow that community until there're self-serve elements they can play with.
            - Don't start a competition before the game has players.
