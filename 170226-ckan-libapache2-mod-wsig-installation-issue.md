title: CKAN Lib Apache Installation Issue
date: 2017-02-26
---

So CKAN relies on `libapache2-mod-wsgi` to run various bits and bobs. Unfortunately for me I've ran into an issue. Attempting to install `libapache2-mod-wsgi` inside a Scotchbox Vagrant VM gives me the following error:

```bash
WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
    libapache2-mod-wsgi

Install these packages without verification? [y/N]
```

Selecting `yes` leads onto this error:

```bash
Err http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php5-5.6/ubuntu/ trusty/main libapache2-mod-wsgi amd64 4.3.0-1+deb.sury.org~trusty+1

404  Not Found

E: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php5-5.6/ubuntu/pool/main/m/mod-wsgi/libapache2-mod-wsgi_4.3.0-1+deb.sury.org~trusty+1_amd64.deb  404  Not Found

E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?
```

Essentially, Ubuntu is having a hard time finding this package. The suggestion is to run `sudo apt-get update`, however all that does is point out that it can't find the location of the dependancy:

```bash
Err http://ppa.launchpad.net trusty/main amd64 Packages                     	404  Not Found

W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php5-5.6/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found

E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
```

Running through the rest of the CKAN installation without this dependacy is likely to cause lots of issues later on down the road, so it's best to fix this now.

## Installing From Source

The best solution that we have at the moment is to build `libapache2-mod-wsgi` from source. Building from source is always an adventure, so we'll see what happens.

First create a sources directory and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir ~/sources
cd ~/sources
```

Then pull down the package tar ball and unpack it:

```bash
wget https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/archive/4.5.15.tar.gz 
tar xvfz 4.5.15.tar.gz
```

Now, anoyingly we need another two packages in order to put this one together. Here they are:

```bash
sudo aptitude install python-dev apache2-prefork-dev
```

I got a message saying that `apache2-prefork-dev` existsted in the package database, but it wasn't a real package. This meant that  had to remove `python-ckan{b}` before moving on with these two packages. Fairly anoying, but I can always reinstall the removed package once I've got `libapache2-mod-wsgi` installed.

Next we need to cd into the unpacked folder, configure everything, and then install `libapache2-mod-wsgi`.

```bash
cd mod_wsgi-4.5.15/
./configure
make
```

Yet another error pops up this time for me:

```bash
apxs -c -I/usr/include/python2.7 -DNDEBUG -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2  -Wc,-g -Wc,-O2  src/server/mod_wsgi.c src/server/wsgi_*.c -L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib/python2.7/config  -lpython2.7 -lpthread -ldl  -lutil -lm
/bin/sh: 1: apxs: not found
make: *** [src/server/mod_wsgi.la] Error 127
```

According to a [Stack Overflow post](//stackoverflow.com/questions/16854750/issues-installing-mod-wsgi-cannot-find-makefile-in) this is due to not having the dev version of apache2 installed. Kinda stupid that the error message didn't allude to this in *any way*.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apache2-dev
```

There we go. Now we can run `make` and it should go through nicely. Now that `libapache2-mod-wsgi` is finally installed we can move along to actually installing the rest of CKAN.
