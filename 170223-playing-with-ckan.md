You probably already know what CKAN is, so there's really no point in me explaining that to you. This post, however, will attempt to guide you through building CKAN from source. Keep in mind that I did all this using Ubuntu 16.04LTS. Good luck

## Dependencies

First step is to install the required dependencies. The following command was taken from the [CKAN docs](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/installing/install-from-source.html)

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-dev postgresql libpq-dev python-pip python-virtualenv git-core solr-jetty openjdk-6-jdk redis-server
```

There's a couple of things we need to fix here though. First, `openjdk-6-jdk` isn't a thing anymore, so we're gonna install `openjdk-9-jdk` instead. Secondly, we need to grab `virtualenv` as well. So the above command should actually look like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-dev postgresql libpq-dev python-pip python-virtualenv git-core solr-jetty openjdk-9-jdk redis-server virtualenv
```

## Symlink

The [docs](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/installing/install-from-source.html) suggest creating a symlink the directories used in the docs to my home folder, making it easier to copy and paste in example commands and all that stuff. Sounds like a sensible suggestion, symlink it is.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ckan/lib
sudo ln -s ~/ckan/lib /usr/lib/ckan
mkdir -p ~/ckan/etc
sudo ln -s ~/ckan/etc /etc/ckan
```

## Virtual Environment

Next up is to install CKAN into a Python virtual environment. Never done this before, could be fun:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/ckan/default
sudo chown `whoami` /usr/lib/ckan/default

virtualenv --no-site-packages /usr/lib/ckan/default
. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate
```

### Keeping Your Virtual Environment Alive

The virtual environment has to stay active for the rest of the installation. You can tell if it is still active by looking for the `(default)` in your terminal like this:

```bash
(default) john@ubuntu: ~/$
```

So if your machine reboots or shutdown or sets on fire or whatever, just run `. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate` to get things back up and running again.

## Install the CKAN Source Code

To install the latest stable release of CKAN (currently 2.6.1) run:

```bash
pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/ckan/ckan.git@ckan-2.6.1#egg=ckan'
```

Anoyingly there isn't anyway of finding out which is the latest and most stable version, we just have to rely on [the docs](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/installing/install-from-source.html). So if you're reading this a month or so after the published date, take a look at the [official CKAN documentation](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/installing/install-from-source.html) to see is 2.6.1 is still the latest version.

## Python Modules

We need to install the following Python modules that CKAN uses. These are installed directly into your virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/requirements.txt
```

I had an issue here were python couldn't find `pg_config`.

```bash
writing pip-egg-info/psycopg2.egg-info/PKG-INFO
writing top-level names to pip-egg-info/psycopg2.egg-info/top_level.txt
writing dependency_links to pip-egg-info/psycopg2.egg-info/dependency_links.txt
writing manifest file 'pip-egg-info/psycopg2.egg-info/SOURCES.txt'
Error: pg_config executable not found.

...

Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-C1PpP1/psycopg2/
```

The error suggested that I needed to add the directory containing `pg_config` to the PATH or specify the full executable path with the option:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --pg-config /path/to/pg_config build ...
```

[Joar's answer on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5450183) fixed my issue. Run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev
```

If you run into further problems here, it could be that you're using an older version of CKAN. Previous to v2.1 the requirements file was called `pip-requirements.txt`, and not `requirements.txt`. Try running the below command if you're having issues:

```bash
pip install -r /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/pip-requirements.txt
```

## Reboot the Virtual Environment

To make sure everything's working all fine and dandy we need to deactivate and reactivate your virtual environment. This way we can make sure that we're using the virtual environment's copies of commands like `paster` rather than the system-wide copies.

```bash
deactivate
```

You should now be back to your normal terminal:

```bash
john@ubuntu:~/$
```

Now just load everything back up with:

```bash
. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate
```

## Checking PostgreSQL

Regardless of how you pronounce it, we have to install PostgreSQL. It's fairly easy, only a few commands to run.

First we should check that it's actually been installed properly.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -l
```

If you get something like `sudo: unknown user: postgresql` then PostgreSQL probably didn't install properly. Run: `sudo apt-get install postgresql` to fix that.

Once that's all taken care off run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -l
```

You might have to input your password, and even then you might get something that says permission denided. However as long as you end up with something looking like a table then you're ok:

```text
Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------
postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 | 
template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
|          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_GB.UTF-8 | en_GB.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
        |          |          |             |             | postgres=CTc/postgres
(3 rows)
```

## Create DB

Now we're gonna try and create the PostgreSQL database and all that business. Let's start with creating a database user:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser -S -D -R -P ckan_default
```

You'll be asked to enter a password, and then one again to confirm you typed it all correctly. You'll probably want to write this down somewhere, it's going to become useful later.

Next we're going to create a new database called `ckan_default`, which will be owned by the user we just created in the last command.

```bash
sudo -u postgres createdb -O ckan_default ckan_default -E utf-8
```

## CKAN Config File

So CKAN uses a config file to help set itself up and run all it's crap. It's really simple to make, but kinda catastrophic if you mess it up so pay attention.

Start off by making a directory that gonna contain all the config files;

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ckan/default
```

Then go ahead and `chmod` them so that their permissions are set properly and we don't have to `sudo` everywhere:

```bash
sudo chown -R `whoami` /etc/ckan/
sudo chown -R `whoami` ~/ckan/etc
```

Once that's all done make the CKAN config file itself:

```bash
paster make-config ckan /etc/ckan/default/development.ini
```

## Editing the Config File

We've now made the file and given it the correct permissions, but now we need to actually fill it with the options we'll be using down the road.

Edit the development.ini file in a text editor (Nano, Vim, Emacs, doesn't matter which one - they all do the same thing) and make the following changes:

### SQL Alchemy

This should point to the DB we made earlier: `sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://ckan_default:pass@localhost/ckan_default
`. Just replace `pass` with the password that you set before.

### Site ID

Each CKAN site should have a unique site_id. Just set it to `ckan.site_id = default` for now.

### Site URL

The same goes for the url. This is used when putting links to the site into the FileStore, notification emails, etc. For now use `ckan.site_url = http://demo.ckan.org`

There's no need to add a trailing slash onto the URL here.

## Solr

CKAN uses Solr as its search platform, and uses a customized Solr schema file that takes into account CKANâ€™s specific search needs. Now that we have CKAN installed and all set up, we need to install Solr.

I'm not going to go into how to install Solr here, since it varies massively depending on your OS. Use the [Solr docs](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html) to guide you to where you need to go.

## Flip Some Tables

It's time to actually start dealing with tables and exciting database things.:

```bash
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan
paster db init -c /etc/ckan/default/development.ini
```

if that worked then you should see `Initialising DB: SUCCESS`.

If the above command asks for a password then you probably haven't set up the sqlalchemy.url option in your CKAN config file. Go back up to [Step 9](#step-9-editing-the-config-file) and follow that section through again. If you're still having problems then check out the [CKAN docs on config files](//docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html).

## The Datastore

Funnily enough the Datastore is not a shop where you can buy your data. This is an optional step, so it you want to learn more about it read up on the [CKAN docs](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/installing/install-from-source.html#set-up-the-datastore)

## Who
No, this has nothing to do with the band [The Who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c1hYO_BYHY). It's an initilization file that needs to be accessible in the same directory as your CKAN config file. The easiest way to achieve this is to create a symlink to it:

```bash
ln -s /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/who.ini /etc/ckan/default/who.ini
```

## You're Finished

That's it! Well, like, that's not everything obviously, now you have to actually go through the process of making your development changes and doing loads of funky stuff that'll make the world a better place, or something like that.

But you CAN now server CKAN and use it in your web browser:

```bash
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan
paster serve /etc/ckan/default/development.ini
```

You should probably run [CKAN's tests](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/test.html) just to make sure that everything is working.
