Clear communication is difficult, especially in teams with remote members. Even in small groups, communications can become cluttered and unmanageable when using email. Sending a simple message to a group of people can tricky and overly complicated.

Our team faced these problems, and we wanted a solution where we could all share information in a simple and transparent way. The key word here is transparent. In any team, it's incredibly important to know what everyone else is doing, so that you can better coordinate your movements. Pretty much any play in a rugby team will spend most of the match shouting to their players, letting them know what's going on.

This is where Slack comes in.

Slack was launched in August 2013 and has grown year after year as the go-to communication tool for software development teams. It was originally created and used as an in-house tool by a games company as a "Searchable Log of All Conversations and Knowledge".

By far the most important part of Slack is that all our team's communications happen in one place. No more searching through emails, or Skype conversations, and post it notes on whiteboards. Everything any of us has ever written in the general channel is searchable in one place, via one search bar, in one app.

This sounds like Slack could get cluttered quickly, but having well-defined channels for each topic of conversation mitigates this problem. For example, we have a #general channel for day to day work conversation, a #random channel for team banter and chit-chat, a #dumptruck channel to use as a group file repository and Pastebin, and a #secure channel for storing sensitive information like server credentials and login details.

Another critical feature of Slack is its integration with other services. We use Trello a lot of keep tabs on what work needs to get done, who's doing what, and what has already been completed. It's a great tool for devs and project managers to keep tabs on what's going on during a project.

Linking Slack and Trello together allows us to create, update, and delete individual tasks quickly from within the app. Sharing tasks is also incredibly simple, just copy and paste the card URL into the Slack chat window and you're golden!

There's a huge bunch of applications that support Slack integration. You can take a look at the complete list here: https://jisc-census-support.slack.com/apps
