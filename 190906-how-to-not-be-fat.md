A word of caution, this article contains a fuck-tonne of swear words and evolution and shit. If you're not into that kind of stuff then you should probably skip this one.

## TLDR

1. Skip breakfast.
2. Lose weight.
3. Send me beer money.

## Step one, Eat Less

There's a lot of bullshit around when it comes to losing weight. There's this idea that you need to eat particular foods, or only eat green stuff, or live like a caveman to be healthy. It's all utter crap. The only rule you need to follow when trying to lose weight is this:

> Put in less than what you put out.

That's all there is to it. If you're eating 3000 calories, but only using 2000 calories every day, then you're gonna put on weight. Your body does this by turning unused energy into fat. On the flip side, if you use 3000 calories a day but only eat 2000 calories, then your body is gonna burn that fat to use as energy!

With me so far?

So the issue remains, how to do this? Like I said before, there's a bunch of diets that claim to be the best way in the world to lose weight, and they all follow this basic principle. They just differ in the stuff that you can eat. And generally speaking, they all work. But the issue with a diet is that eventually you'll stop doing the diet and go right back to eating a shit load of food every day. So what you need is a meal plan that allows you to eat what you want, without gaining any weight.

Just skip a meal. Dead easy.

This is probably gonna sound horrifying to a lot of you. Most of us were taught that we need to eat three square meals a day or you'll wither away and die. Fucking, bullshit. Yeah, humans need to eat, but there is no hard and fast rule built into our bodies that says you need to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.

I'm gonna mention evolution here so if you hate Charles Darwin, go ahead and skip this paragraph. Back in _caveman times_ humans would eat every few days. They'd go out, make a kill, gorge on it for a bit, and then spend the next few days not eating while hunting for the next thing to eat. Only in recent times have humans been able to generate so much food that we can eat all fucking day.

By skipping a meal, you're taking ~600 to ~1000 calories out of the equation. So if you're currently eating 2500 calories but only need 2000 calories, then you're winning!

I can hear you now, "_but if I don't eat I get hangry!_" You'll learn to fucking deal with it. Say you skip breakfast. For the first week or so you might find yourself waking up hungry and counting down the seconds until lunch. But your body will adapt. Strictly speaking, it's just your brain you've got to convince. For your entire life, you've been eating three meals a day, so your brain has gotten used to the idea that if it sends a hunger single at 8 am, 12 pm, and 6 pm, it'll get that lovely dopamine boost that comes with food. But all it takes it about of week of skipping breakfast for your brain to realize that it's not getting anything. Another thing to keep in mind is food cravings only ever last about 10 minutes, and caffeine helps suppress your hunger. So if you hit 11 am and are starting to get hungry, just have a coffee.

_But why skip breakfast? Why not lunch or dinner?_ You can skip whichever meal or meals you want! I only have one meal a day at around 7 pm. One huge benefit of skipping breakfast and lunch is that my body doesn't have to deal with digesting any food while I'm working. The digestive system takes up a huge amount of energy when dealing with food.

What I've been talking about here is called _intermittent fasting_. There's a bunch of info out in the wild about it, and the various benefits it can offer. I'm not sure which ones are true, but the idea that it can help you lose your fat is completely true.

## Step two, Carry on Eating Less

Like I mentioned before, the issue with most diets is that it's incredibly hard to keep the diet going. Say you're following the keto diet. You start out doing great, you're staying away from carbs and losing weight. But then it's your mate's birthday and you chug a glass of champagne, or chomp on a tiny bit of cake, or destroy a handful of chips. Now you're fucked. You've thrown your body out of ketosis. So you think, _fuck it, I'll just go back to eating normally, I've lost all this weight_. Next thing you know you're back to being a fat-fuck again and it was all for nothing.

Skipping a meal is easy to maintain. Most of the time people slip on their diets because of social aspects. They want to go out with friends or family, and eat or drink what they want! Remember, losing weight is just about consuming fewer calories than you put out. So if you've got a family breakfast on Saturday the go ahead! Eat breakfast! Just skip lunch or dinner. Or skip neither and just carry on with skipping breakfast on Sunday!

Lots of us have been in a situation where we're calorie counting everything we eat every day. While calorie counting itself isn't _terrible_ limiting your count to each day is a fucking awful idea. Say you currently eat about 2500 a day, and want to reduce that to 2200 a day. You _could_ swap a meal for a salad, or never eat chips, or swear off booze for the rest of your life. But you're not going to keep that up. Instead, let's do a little math:

```text
2200 calories * 7 days = 15400 calories
```

So you've got 15400 calories to spend a week. Instead of spending the exact same amount each day, why not budget yourself a bit better. Let's say skipping breakfast loses you around ~500 a day.

```text
2500 calories - 500 calories = 2000 calories
2000 calories * 7 days = 14000 calories
```

Looking at this we can see that at the end of a week we'll still have 1400 calories to spend in order to reach our goal of 2200 calories a day. So those few pints you had on Friday after work? Not a big issue. That kebab you had on the way home? That's fine too! Because through your 7-day average, you're still running a calorie-deficit, you're still burning more than you put in!
