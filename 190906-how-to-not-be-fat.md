# How to not be fat

A word of caution, this article contains a fuck-tonne of swear words and mentions evolution and shit. If you're not into that kind of stuff, go ahead and skip this one.

## TLDR

1. Skip breakfast.
2. Lose weight.
3. Send me money to say thank you.

## Step one, Eat Less

There's a lot of bullshit around when it comes to losing weight. There's this idea that you need to eat particular foods, or only eat green stuff, or live like a caveman. It's all utter crap. The only rule you need to follow when trying to lose weight is this:

> Put in less than what you put out.

That's all there is to it. If you're eating 3000 calories, but only using 2000 calories every day, then you're gonna put on weight. Your body does this by turning unused energy into fat. On the flip side, if you use 3000 calories a day but only eat 2000 calories, then your body is gonna burn that fat to use as energy!

With me so far?

So the issue remains, how to do this? Like I said before, there's a bunch of diets that claim to be the best way in the world to lose weight, and they all follow this basic principle. They just differ in the stuff that you can eat. And generally speaking, they all work. But the issue with a diet is that eventually you'll stop doing the diet and go right back to eating a shit load of food every day. So what you need is a meal plan that allows you to eat what you want, without gaining any weight.

Just skip a meal. Dead easy.

This is probably gonna sound horrifying to a lot of you. Most of us were taught that we need to eat three square meals a day or you'll wither away and die. Fucking, bullshit. Yeah, humans need to eat, but there is no hard and fast rule built into our bodies that says you need to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.

I'm gonna mention evolution here so if you hate Charles Darwin, go ahead and skip this paragraph. Back in _caveman times_ humans would eat every few days. They'd go out, make a kill, gorge on it for a bit, and then spend the next few days not eating while hunting for the next thing to eat. Only in recent times have humans been able to generate so much food that we can eat all fucking day.

By skipping a meal, you're taking ~600 to ~1000 calories out of the equation. So if you're currently eating 2500 calories but only need 2000 calories, then you're winning!

I can hear you now, "_but if I don't eat I get hangry!_" You'll learn to fucking deal with it. Say you skip breakfast. For the first week or so you might find yourself waking up hungry and counting down the seconds until lunch. But your body will adapt. Strictly speaking, it's just your brain you've got to convince. For your entire life, you've been eating three meals a day, so your brain has gotten used to the idea that if it sends a hunger single at 8 am, 12 pm, and 6 pm, it'll get food. But all it takes it about of week of skipping breakfast for your brain to realize that it's not getting anything. Another thing to keep in mind is food cravings only ever last about 10 minutes, and caffeine helps suppress your hunger. So if you hit 11 am and are starting to get hungry, just have a coffee.

_But why skip breakfast? Why not lunch or dinner?_ You can skip whichever meal or meals you want! I only have one meal a day at around 7 pm. One huge benefit of skipping breakfast and lunch is that my body doesn't have to deal with digesting any food while I'm working. The digestive system takes up a huge amount of energy when dealing with food.

What I've been talking about here is called _intermittent fasting_. There's a bunch of info out in the wild about it, and the various benefits it can offer. I'm not sure which ones are true, but the idea that it can help you lose your fat is completely true.
