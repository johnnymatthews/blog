# Working with DKAN
DKAN is a Drupal-based platform that allows governments, nonprofits, universities, and other groups to showcase their open data. It comes with a full suite of cataloging, publishing, and visualization features right out of the box.

In this series, I'll be walking through: 
 1. [How to create a suitable server environment](#)
 1. [Installing DKAN on the server](#)
 1. [Creating a backup and restore procedure](#)
 1. [Setting up a local DKAN environment with Vagrant](#)

 The tutorials are designed to be *stand-alone*, so you can jump in at any point. However I strongly recommend starting from the beginning.
