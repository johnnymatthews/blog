My god this has been a long time coming. I'd like to say it's because of _life-stuff_, just things getting in the way. Since I wrote the original post back in 2017 (posted to Medium in 2018), I've changed jobs, moved house, moved house again, moved countries, got a new job, and now I'm moving house again next week. My life has been pretty exciting and very much not-static. But the story about Maree Docia hasn't really changed.

My first port of call was to email the company Epidemic Sound to see if they could give me any information, mainly who Maree is, what contact they've had with her, and where she came from.
