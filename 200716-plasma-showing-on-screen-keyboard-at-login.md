# Plasma showing on-screen keyboard at login

I experienced a weird issue with Plasma and Kubuntu (the KDE flavour of Ubuntu) recently. Plasma is the desktop environment that comes default with Kubuntu, and it built by the KDE team. It's pretty nice, and works pretty well. At least, unless you try to uninstall the Clipboard app that comes built-in with Kubuntu.

The clipboard app just keeps a record of everything that's been in your clipboard. A fairly useful utility, unless you copy your passwords to clipboard using a password manager. So, to mitigate security issues I decided to get rid of the clipboard app. I used Kubuntu's built in software center _Discover_, clicked **Installed** and scrolled down until I found **KDE Plasma Desktop - Clipboard**. Then I clicked **Remove** and carried on with my day.

A while later I needed to reboot my machine, so I did. But when it came time to login, I was greeted with a completely different screen to my usual login experience. For one thing, an onscreen keyboard took up the entirity of the screen, and it was set to _British English_ for some reason. I am English, but I live in Canada, so not sure how KDE figured that one out.

After closing down the huge on-screen keyboard I tried to login with my password. Annoyingly the login screen wouldn't do anything when I pressed `enter`. I even tried bringing up the on-screen keyboard and logging in that way, but still, the desktop environment refused to let me press `enter`.

So, I opened the terminal (`ctrl` + `alt` + `f2` if you wanted to know) and had a look around. After some digging, it turns out the clipboard app I uninstalled earlier is somehow tied to the Plasma desktop environment and without it, entry past the login screen was blocked.

I was hoping to simply re-install the clipboard app, but it turns out you can't. What you _can_ do, however, is reinstall the Plasma software. First I connected to the wifi:

    ```bash
    sudo iwconfig wlo1 essid WIFI_NAME key s:WIFI_PASSWORD
    ```

Then I removed `plasma-desktop-data` installed `plasma-desktop`:

	```bash
	sudo apt remove plasma-desktop-data -y
	sudo apt install plasma-desktop
	```

After that I did a quick reboot I found that it fixed most things. The on-screen keyboard popped up, but I was able to minimize it and login. Once I was in, everything looked the same. Tool bars were in the same place, touchpad settings still worked, all that stuff.
