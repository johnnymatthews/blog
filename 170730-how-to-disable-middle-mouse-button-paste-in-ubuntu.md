Find out the `id` of your mouse by running `xinput list | grep 'id='`. This should give you a list similar to the following:

```bash
⎡ Virtual core pointer id=2 [master pointer (3)]
⎜ ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer id=4 [slave pointer (2)]
⎜ ↳ PixArt Microsoft USB Optical Mouse id=10 [slave pointer (2)]
⎣ Virtual core keyboard id=3 [master keyboard (2)]
 ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard id=5 [slave keyboard (3)]
 ↳ Power Button id=6 [slave keyboard (3)]
 ↳ Power Button id=7 [slave keyboard (3)]
 ↳ Logitech USB Keyboard id=8 [slave keyboard (3)]
 ↳ Logitech USB Keyboard id=9 [slave keyboard (3)]
```

Now, my mouse has *Microsoft* written on the back, so I can assume that it's the *PixArt Microsoft USB Optical Mouse*, which has an `id` of 10.

Running `xinput get-button-map 10` will give me a pretty useless list of all the buttons my mouse has:

```bash
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

Luckily [some people on the internet happen to know which number represents the middle mouse button, and it's the 2nd number in (`2` in this case). To disable the paste function of the middle mouse button, but still retain the scroll functions, we need to change that second number to a 0. To do this run the following command:

```bash
xinput set-button-map 10 1 0 3
```

And that's it! Should work just fine now! You may have to add this to a startup script or something like that to make sure it runs every time you turn your computer on.
